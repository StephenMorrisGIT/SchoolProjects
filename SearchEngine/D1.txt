In order to install DR DOS you must make sure that you are
booting from a floppy in drive A:. DR DOS will not install
from drive B:. DR DOS comes on 3 1/2 inch low density
floppies and 5 1/4 inch Hi-density floppies. If you need
5 1/4 inch low-density disks (360K) send in the coupon that
comes with your DR DOS.

If the boot disk hangs while trying to load, usually it means
there is an incompatible or faulty piece of hardware.

One of the things it can be is simply an older floppy 
drive that is out of alignment.  Sometimes the situation
can be salvaged by formatting a floppy on the boot drive
with the old DOS, then doing a diskcopy. The potential 
problem is that the diskcopy may not be able to read the 
boot disk either. If you can't make a backup then it may 
be necessary to get a replacement disk set from Digital
Research (in case there is an actual error with the disk,
which does sometime happen) or see about getting the 
drives aligned.
