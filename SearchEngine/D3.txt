And finally, if you can read the disks but are unable to 
	format a disk or make a diskcopy DR DOS may think you 
	have a different type of floppy than you actually have.
	Another symptom of this is if you are making a floppy
	installation and DR DOS asks you for 5 1/4" floppies
	when you actually have 3 1/2" floppies. If this is an XT
        type computer (by which we mean it has no CMOS config-
	uration program) then you can place a DRIVPARM state-
	ment in your CONFIG.SYS. Refer to the DR DOS manual to
	see how to use this parameter. DRIVPARM uses no RAM. It
	merely updates the DR DOS drive tables with the type
	drive you specify. If your computer does have a CMOS 
	setup program then you need to correct the entries for
        your floppy drives in CMOS.
