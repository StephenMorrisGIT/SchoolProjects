Another problem is where you can make valid Diskcopies 
but all you get is the message "Loading...". Here the
potential problem may be the computer's bios. DR DOS 
must be able to direct the system to the area where DOS 
Kernel files are located. Older bioses are not able to 
perform this function. If your bios dates from around
1987 or earlier you may need an update.
